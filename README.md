# DUCKS4

FSHD-analysis tool for Nanopore-Sequencing.
Lightweight FSHD analysis workflow for Oxford Nanopore sequencing.

Facioscapulohumeral Muscular Dystrophy (FSHD) is an autosomal dominant form of muscular dystrophy caused by genetic or epigenetic changes within the D4Z4-repeat at the DUX4-gene, on chromosome 4q. Genetic analysis is challenging due to a nearly identical region on chromosome 10, multiple haplotypes, long and short repeat subtypes, and complex rearrangements such as translocations and duplications. So far, no single method detects all known causes of FSHD.

We have developed an integrated approach combining an optimized wet-lab protocol with an automated bioinformatics workflow, called DUCKS4. It enables read-level resolution of the D4Z4 array for FSHD1 repeat sizing and detection of methylation patterns. Using NCBI BLAST, it assigns reads to chromosomes and haplotypes, supporting robust filtering and analysis. With long-read Nanopore sequencing technology, our tool enables precise determination of D4Z4 array size, individual haplotype assignment, methylation profiling, and complex allele analysis. It also allows for the detection of mosaicism and structural variation like interchromosomal translocations, providing a comprehensive, single-method solution for FSHD analysis.

**Attention: Small version WITHOUT variant-calling!**\
This version does NOT include variant calling and an internal T2T-chm13 reference in order to reduce runtime, dependencies and Docker image size.
Please provide your own T2T reference via --ref_t2t.

DUCKS4_wovar focuses on:

- 4qA, 4qB and 10qA haplotype assignment
- D4Z4 repeat sizing
- PAS characterization
- Detection of chimeric and complex alleles
- Repeat structure reconstruction
- Optional methylation analysis
- Optional per-RU BinI/XapI restriction site classification (BX check) via ID2bam2meth (experimental)


**v1.1.0:**

Major changes:

Updated ID2bam2meth workflow:
- Removed dependency on external BLAST annotation files.
- Automatic reference-read re-BLASTing.
- Automatic orientation detection.
- Automatic annotation curation.
- Added distal_unit methylation region in ID2bam2meth.
- Simplified methylation workflow.
- Integrated per-RU BinI/XapI restriction site classification (BX check) into the ID2bam2meth workflow. (Experimental)

Patch:

Fix dplyr compatibility.

**v1.0.1:**

DUCKS4 also calls directly the PAS-sequence to each read if pLAM is available and provides it in the haplotype-resolved output csv-files. It tests if the PAS is intact (4qA), 10qA or differently disrupted.

## Analysis of individual read-subsets - ID2BAM2METH

The DUCKS4-results make it easy to directly select reads for individual subsets for further alignment, optional methylation-calling and analysis. 
If further subsets of reads should be filtered and analyzed, a read-id.txt needs to be provided along the alignment .bam-file.
Furthermore a custom reference can be created from a read-id or an existing reference can be given.

The intended the workflow is: 
> **DUCKS4** → manual review and allele-level subsetting of results → **ID2bam2meth** for improved allele-specific alignment and methylation analysis

**Note**: Subsetting reads is necessary for example when two 4qA alleles are present and the methylation status should be called separately. The tool cannot distinguish two 4qA alleles and requires manual curation in that case.

With this script it is possible to define a custom reference from a chosen read via read-id (e.g. choose a complete read from the 4qA output). 
Optionally provide a subset of reads to align against (either read-ids via TXT and/or a BAM-file) and optionally call methylation.
For the custom reference the blast-results of this read are annotated within an annotation.bed file and if --methyl is chosen the average methylation will be calculated for each entry within the annotation.bed file. 
The results can then be further inspected in a genome viewer like the IGV-browser.

### Mode A: for creating a custom reference
```
docker run -it --rm -v "$(pwd)":/data ghcr.io/tamara-nano/fshd_ducks4:v1.2.0 id2bam2meth \
  --id_ref READ_ID \
  --bam_ref /data/sample-containing_id_ref-read.bam \
  --bam /data/sample.bam \
  --txt /data/read-ids.txt \
  --methyl
```

**Note**: \
From the read-id a reference FASTA, FAIDX and annotation.bed file from the blast-output is created. \
Please be aware that the id_ref needs to be present in the bam_ref input. \
Methylation is called over all regions from the annotation.bed if no other regions are given (e.g. --regions_bed). \
Therefore a methylation-gradient over all D4Z4-RUs can be called and will be provided as .bedgraph output and for convenience as .bed file with values as labels.
Also an aggregated region as distal_unit containing the most distal repeat and pLAM region is defined and methylation called for it.
The BX restriction site check is automatically run after methylation analysis and results are written to `{allele_id}/D4Z4_BX_check/`.

### Mode B: providing an existing reference
```
docker run -it --rm -v "$(pwd)":/data ghcr.io/tamara-nano/fshd_ducks4:v1.2.0 id2bam2meth \
  --ref /data/ref.fasta \
  --bam /data/sample.bam \
  --txt /data/read-ids.txt \
  --methyl \
...
  optional:
...
  --region chr:start-end
```
or
```
  --regions_bed /data/regions.bed
```

**Note**: \
If no custom regions are provided, ID2bam2meth automatically generates annotations from the supplied reference FASTA using BLAST. \
The reference FASTA is automatically copied into the output folder for use with the BX check and IGV visualization.

### Creating the read-ID.txt: 
Simply copy the read-IDs you want to subset and filter from the DUCKS4-output tables into a txt-file:

Format read-id.txt:

```
read-id1
read-id3
read-id5
...
```

- D4Z4_BX_check/: BinI/XapI restriction site classification per RU (see BX check section above)

### Curated methylation output

Methylation values are reported for:

- CLUHP4
- D4F104S1
- individual D4Z4 repeat units
- pLAM
- DUX4_end

Additionally, the following aggregate regions are reported:

- distal_unit: terminal RU plus pLAM (contains the DUX4 polyadenylation signal)

distal_unit is included because distal methylation is particularly relevant for FSHD diagnostics.

### BinI/XapI per-RU restriction site classification (BX check) [EXPERIMENTAL]

The BX check is automatically run as part of the methylation workflow in ID2bam2meth and classifies each D4Z4 repeat unit (RU) of an assigned allele based on the presence or absence of two restriction enzyme recognition sequences detected directly from read alignments:

| Site | Enzyme | Sequence | D4Z4 type |
|:-----|:-------|:---------|:----------|
| B+ | BinI/AvrII | CCTAGG | intact in Chr10_D4Z4 |
| X+ | XapI/ApoI | AAATTCC | intact in Chr4_D4Z4 |

Three D4Z4 unit types are distinguished:

| Type | B site | X site | Meaning |
|:-----|:-------|:-------|:--------|
| Chr4_D4Z4 | B- | X+ | XapI site intact, BinI site absent |
| Chr10_D4Z4 | B+ | X- | BinI site intact, XapI site absent |
| Hybrid_D4Z4 | B- | X- | neither site intact — hybrid/mix unit |

Sites are detected with up to 1 mismatch tolerance (fuzzy matching) to account for SNVs that disrupt restriction sites without abolishing the unit's identity. Exact matches and fuzzy matches (mm=1) are reported separately in the BED output.

Per-RU consensus is built by majority vote across all reads covering each RU position. Confidence = fraction of reads agreeing with the majority call. RUs with fewer than 3 covering reads are flagged as `low_coverage`; RUs where fewer than 60% of reads agree are flagged as `ambiguous_consensus`.

### BX check output

The BX check output is written to `{out_prefix}/D4Z4_BX_check/` and contains:

| File | Description |
|:-----|:------------|
| `BX_per_RU.csv` | Per-read per-RU classification table |
| `BX_summary.csv` | Per-read summary of RU type counts |
| `BX_consensus.csv` | Per-RU consensus type, confidence, and read counts |
| `array_structure.csv` | Compact array structure string (e.g. `c10-c4-c4-c4-c4-c4-c4-c4`) |
| `BX_sites.bed` | RU-level BED colored by D4Z4 type for IGV (itemRgb) |
| `BX_sites.bedgraph` | Per-RU consensus confidence as bedGraph for IGV |
| `BX_restriction_sites.bed` | Exact BinI/XapI site positions within each RU for IGV navigation |

IGV colors: blue = Chr10_D4Z4 (B+/X-), red = Chr4_D4Z4 (B-/X+), purple = Hybrid_D4Z4 (B-/X-), grey = ambiguous/unclassified.


## Further analysis

Sometimes it will be necessary to further determine the sub-haplotype of the allele. Therefore a scheme was developed to make it easy to distinguish the haplotypes (Tab.1) (sub-HP-help-sheet.xlsx). With the bed-file "Haplotypes_identification_regions.bed" (found in the DUCKS4 folder where also the script is) the necessary regions and all relevant SNPs within D4F104S1 and the pLAM region as well as the restriction sites for BinI and XapI within the proximal D4Z4-RUs are marked. Relevant is the SSLP repeat in the CLUHP4-201 gene and the first 3–5 repeat units with the restriction enzyme sites of the D4Z4-array.

## Example Data

Example data can be found on Figshare: 10.6084/m9.figshare.29930690

This repository contains the sequencing data from the human reference genomes HG001, HG002 and HG003 from whole genome sequencing and adaptive sampling runs with long-read sequencing with Nanopore (Oxford Nanopore Technologies, UK). The high molecular weight (HMW) DNA from the cell cultures were extracted with Monarch HMW-DNA Extraction Kit for Tissue (NEB, US) and the library prepared with SQK-ULK114 Kit (Oxford Nanopore Technologies, UK). The data were basecalled with Dorado basecaller with methylation calling for 5mCG and 5hmCG in SUP mode. The sequencing data are mapped, indexed and sorted BAM files aligned to the T2T-chm13v2.0 reference and further filtered for the D4Z4 locus on chromosome 4 (4q35) and the homologous region on chromosome 10 (10q26).
